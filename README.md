# PongThing
A Pong type game I made to practice using SDL2. Covered in Chapter 1 of "Game Programming in C++" by Sanjay Madhav. With some modifications by me.

<h2>Building and running</h2>
This project requires SDL2 and Visual Studio (I think). However, there isn't much extra insight to be gained from playing a game this small.

<h2>Controls</h2>
W / Up arrow: Move up <br>
S / Down arrow: Move down

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
